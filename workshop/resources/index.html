<p><strong>Essays:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://marcgarrett.org/2014/02/12/diwo-do-it-with-others-artistic-co-creation-as-a-decentralized-method-of-peer-empowerment-in-todays-multitude/">Marc Garrett on DIWO</a> - DIWO (Do-It-With-Others): Artistic Co-Creation as a Decentralized Method of Peer Empowerment in Today’s Multitude. The practice of DIWO allows space for an openness where a rich mixing of components from different sources crossover and build a hybrid experience. It challenges and renegotiates the power roles between artists and curators.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://theusercondition.computer/">The User Condition</a> - essay: What are the conditions for a computer user to gain agency, defined here as the ability to evade automatisms? What is the user’s horizon of autonomy within a built world made of software programmed by somebody else, when its logic is made inaccessible in the name of convenience?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml">A Feminist Server Manifesto 0.01</a></p></li>

<p><strong>Philosophies:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://permacomputing.net/">permacomputing</a> - Permacomputing is both a concept and a community of practice oriented around issues of resilience and regenerativity in computer and network technology inspired by permaculture. ପໄଓ☾☼✫ -☆:*´ There are huge environmental and societal issues in today's computing, and permacomputing specifically wants to challenge them in the same way as permaculture has challenged industrial agriculture. With that said, permacomputing is an anti-capitalist political project. It is driven by several strands of anarchism, decoloniality, intersectional feminism, post-marxism, degrowth, ecologism.</li>
