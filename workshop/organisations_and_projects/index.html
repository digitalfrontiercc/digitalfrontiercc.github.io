<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://titipi.org/">The Institute for Technology in the Public Interest (TITiPI)</a> - a trans-practice gathering of activists, artists, engineers and theorists that convene communities to articulate, activate and re-imagine together what computational technologies in the “public interest” might be when “public interest” is always in-the-making.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/">The Engine Room</a> - a non-profit organisation with a distributed global team of experienced and committed activists, researchers, technologists and community organisers.

<li><p><a href="https://www.digitalrights.community/">Team CommUNITY (TCU)</a> a community-based membership network that brings together digital defenders from across the globe fighting surveillance, censorship, and other issues sitting at the intersection of human rights and technology.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.criticaldesignlab.com/">Critical Design Lab</a> - centered in disability culture and crip techno-science. Our work pivots around the concept of access: access is our ethic, our creative content, and our methodology. We use digital media and social practice to craft replicable protocols that treat accessibility as research-creation, an aesthetic world-building practice, and an invitation to assemble community.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://tacticaltech.org/about/">Tactical Tech</a> - Tactical Tech is a creative international non-profit with over two decades of experience dedicated to exploring the socio-political and environmental impacts of technology on society.

<li><p><a href="https://redecentralize.org/">Redecentralize</a> an independent, volunteer-driven organisation promoting the decentralisation of our digital technology.

<li><p><a href="https://data.coop/en/">data.coop</a> - a cooperative, which owns and operates a digital infrastructure for its members. Our fundamental vision is to protect our members’ data. The community consists of members around the Copenhagen-area and is open to inquiries from abroad to start sister infrastructures based on the same principles.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://bitbit.software/">bitbit</a> - Let's leave Big Tech together. Bitbit software is an organisation-in-the-making and sister project of Varia, The Center for Everyday Technology. It was created to help cultural organisations, non-profits and social movements leave Big Tech. Our goal is to promote ways of thinking about and doing digital technology which realise the ideals of Permacomputing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://coopcloud.tech/">coopcloud.tech</a> - Co-op Cloud is a software stack that aims to make hosting libre software applications simple for small service providers such as tech co-operatives who are looking to standardise around an open, transparent and scalable infrastructure. It uses the latest container technologies and configurations are shared into the commons for the benefit of all.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://mur.at/page/home/">mur.at</a> - mur.at enables the networking of diverse art and cultural initiatives in a (shared) virtual space. Similar to university networks that enable collaborative work in the academic field, mur.at is building an infrastructure for the arts.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://yanapak.org/">Yanapak</a> - Yanapak.org is a self-managed server, a collective tool for generating, distributing, and maintaining digital communication infrastructures in Latin America. We are based on the principles of Freedom, Mutual Aid, and the philosophy of Free Software. We were born from the experience of social movements, unions, students, and independent media collectives. We believe in privacy, and therefore it is essential to have our own communication infrastructures, separate from large corporations. Yanapak means "helper" or "servant" in Kichwa, the second most widely spoken language in the Quechua language family. It is spoken in the Sierra and Oriente of Ecuador, in southwestern Colombia, and in the northern lowland jungle of Peru, and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people.</p></li>
